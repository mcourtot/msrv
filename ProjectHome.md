An ontology describing the medical surveillance domain. This is a mid-level resource, building under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and in partnership with the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) and the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO). It is built in collaboration with the Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) and the Adverse Event Reporting Ontology (AERO), and provides a unified upper-level for those resources.
